# My FastAPI Project

This project contains a FastAPI application with a simple HelloWorld API method.

## How to Run

1. **Setting up the FastAPI application:**

    - Install required dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    - Run the FastAPI application:
      ```bash
      uvicorn main:app --reload
      ```

    - Access the API documentation by opening a browser and navigating to:
      ```
      http://localhost:8000/docs
      ```
      This opens the Swagger UI where you can interact with the API methods.

2. **Testing the `get_movie_reviews()` method:**

    - Ensure the FastAPI application is running.

    - Create a new Python test file or update an existing one (e.g., `test_youtube_search.py`) to test the `get_movie_reviews()` method. You can use libraries like `pytest` for testing.

    - Run the tests using `pytest`:
      ```bash
      pytest test_youtube_search.py
      ```

    - Validate that the tests cover different scenarios and assertions for the `get_movie_reviews()` function.

    - Verify the behavior of the function by searching for reviews of different movie titles.

    - Make sure to mock the YouTube search functionality for testing purposes and handle different possible responses.

3. **Interacting with the API:**

    - Open the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

    - To access the HelloWorld API method:
      - Find the method named `read_root`.
      - Click on it to expand the method details.
      - Click on the "Try it out" button.
      - Click "Execute" to see the response.

    - This method provides a basic demonstration of the FastAPI functionality.

## Note
Please ensure that your machine has an active internet connection to perform YouTube searches when testing the `get_movie_reviews()` method.
